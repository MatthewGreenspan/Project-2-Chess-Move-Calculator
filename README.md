# Chess Move Calculator

Native C++ chess puzzle app — drag pieces to set up positions, palettes for promotions, opening statistics, and engine-backed best move. Opens as a desktop window.

**Full build and run instructions:** **[cpp/README.md](cpp/README.md)**

## Quick build (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkg-config cmake   # macOS; Debian/Ubuntu: see cpp/README.md
cd cpp && cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build && ./build/chess-calc
```

Or with **Make** (Unix, from `cpp/`):

```bash
cd cpp && make && ./chess-calc
```

## Quick build (Windows)

Install **Visual Studio** (C++ workload), **CMake**, and **[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)**. Set **`VCPKG_ROOT`**, then from **`cpp/`**:

```bat
%VCPKG_ROOT%\vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release
build\Release\chess-calc.exe
```

Use **`cpp/vcpkg.json`** for SDL2 versions. CMake copies **`assets/`** next to the executable.

## Stockfish (recommended)

For **best move** and **sidebar grades**, install Stockfish (**`brew install stockfish`** on macOS) or run the **shell** fetch script from **`cpp/`** (requires **`bash`**, **`curl`**, **`tar`**):

```bash
sh scripts/fetch_stockfish.sh
```

Without a local binary, **best move** can still use the **Lichess cloud-eval** fallback (needs **`curl`** and network). Grades try Stockfish first, then Lichess when online.

## Run

Run the executable from the **`cpp/`** directory (or keep `assets/` next to the binary — CMake does this automatically).

## Usage

- **Drag pieces** on the board to move them anywhere (free placement) or to legal squares (makes a proper move)
- **Click a piece** to see its legal moves (highlighted in green)
- **Click a legal square** to make the move
- **Drag from palettes** (above/below board) to add pieces — for promotions or setup
- **Drag pieces onto palettes** to remove them from the board
- **Reset** — clear and start over
- **White to move** / **Black to move** — set whose turn and flip the board view
- **Calculate best move** — opening DB (trie + hash timing) or Stockfish; optional **SF grade** line in the sidebar
- **Sidebar** — turn, best move, possible moves, FEN (needs **SDL2_ttf**)
